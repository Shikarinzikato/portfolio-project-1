##  Detailing the history of the band and it`s singers in HTML and CSS.

This Project presents highlights of the a-ha band in a more presentable, readable and watchable and better summarized way resulting in a more enjoyable all round experience in comparison to sites like wikipedia and others, which due to their universality dump all info on to the "searchee" and lack any "presentation" or visual flair.

All information is taken from publicly available sites like:
